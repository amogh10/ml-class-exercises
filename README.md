## Programming Exercises

This are my own implementations to the programming exercises for the
Stanford's Machine Learning course (fall 2011).

### Exercises Summaries

* Exercise 1 - Linear Regression: Implement linear regression and get to see it
work with data.

* Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression: Implement logistic regression and apply it
to two different datasets.

* Exercies 3 - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks: Implement one-vs-all
logistic regress and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.

* Exercise 4 - Neural Networks Learning: Implement the backpropagation algorithm
for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.

* Exercise 5 - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias vs Variance: Implement
regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different
bias-variance properties.
